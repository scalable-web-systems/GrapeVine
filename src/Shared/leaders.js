        description: 'Our CFED, Vineeth, is the most awesome human being to ever live. Without his help, this website would have never been create. He insists that it was a group effort, but we all know that he did most of the work to make this possible.'

        description: 'Our CTSO is actually an imaginary person. We deemed this position to be too powerful for any one person to have (unless it was Vineeth), and so the company created a fake name and ID for Notest, who does not actually test anything. This is a carefully kept secret by the way.'
